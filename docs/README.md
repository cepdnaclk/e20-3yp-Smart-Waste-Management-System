## Introduction

**Problem**: Inefficient waste management leads to overflowing bins, wasted fuel, and missed collection opportunities, affecting both the environment and operational costs.

**Solution**: This IoT-based system automates waste sorting, tracks bin statuses, and optimizes collection routes, improving efficiency and sustainability.

**Impact**: Reduces waste collection costs, minimizes environmental impact, and enhances overall waste management efficiency.
